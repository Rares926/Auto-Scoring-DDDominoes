Computer vision project for automatic scoring of double double dominoes games.

1. the libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library

matplotlib                3.7.1

2. how to run the project and where to look for the output file.

jupiter file : project_orb.ipynb
First run all the cell except the last 2 of them that each contains the calling of a method.
Then change their parameters:
function: proccess_game(path_to_regular_task_images, path_where_to_save_the_predictions,path_to_the_template_attached,number_of_games_to_proccess)
function: resolve_bonus(path_to_bonus_task_images, path_where_to_save_the_predictions,path_to_the_template_attached)
