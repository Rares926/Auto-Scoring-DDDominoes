1. the libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library

Example:


matplotlib                3.7.1                   
numpy                     1.24.2                 
opencv-python             4.7.0.72               


2. how to run your solution and where to look for the output file.

jupiter file : project_orb.ipynb
First run all the cell except the last 2 of them that each contains the calling of a method.
Then change their parameters:
function: proccess_game(path_to_regular_task_images, path_where_to_save_the_predictions,path_to_the_template_attached,5)
function: resolve_bonus(path_to_bonus_task_images, path_where_to_save_the_predictions,path_to_the_template_attached)
